H2 Visa Analysis


In this analysis, the data on H2 visa applications is explored, which are requests by
companies to hire foreign workers for nonagricultural jobs within the United States. The U.S.
Department of Labor releases this data as Excel (.XLS) files and BuzzFeed News has been
tracking and hosting these datasets on Github. The dataset represents H2 applications from October 1, 2010 to March 31, 2016.

Key questions
1. How has the number of approved applications changed over time?
2. How have the number of approved workers changed over time?
3. Which locations and types of businesses request the most visas and how has this
changed over time?
4. Which positions are the most frequently requested for these visas?
